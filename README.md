Use the http.client package to read the contents of the www.uci.edutop level web page and print out the first 3 lines. You will need to use http.client.HTTPSConnection() to make the connection to the www.uci.eduweb page. Then you will need to use conn.request("GET", "/") to send the get request. Then use conn.getresponse() to extract the response and use the read() method of the response to return the contents of the webpage.
